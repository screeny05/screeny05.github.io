        This site is the personal playground of Sebastian &ndash; that's me!

    I use it to experiment and have fun with the web. Aside from that, it's also my blog which mostly contains tech-stuff.

            I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.caseking.de/">Caseking</a> as web-developer. Previously i finished my apprenticeship as IT-Specialist.
            At the moment in the search for fun i'm looking into different stuff like cooking, reading, typography, web-design and paintball.
            Also i am living with my girlfriend in the city of Berlin.

            The pure existence of this site doesn't make me a blogger, but i try to write down everything i learn and experience.
            It's mostly about the things i find interesting &mdash; which doesn't mean i'm not the only one who does.
            Also you can use it to check out some of the stuff i've done / am doing.
